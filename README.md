# CAPP-Int-Old-Non-responsive

This was my third big project and my first 
experience editing someone else's existing code. 
I enjoyed the challenge of making my content 
responsive on a website that is not well
optimized for mobile. I also had the opportunity 
to build my own Javascript photo gallery 
generator so that I didn't have to manually add 
in 300+ images. The gallery script uses a simple 
naming convention so that the images can be 
easily swapped out in the future.

The two pages I made changes to are:

html/gallery.php starting at line 127<br>
html/events.php starting at line 143
